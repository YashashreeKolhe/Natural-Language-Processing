Follow-up report : 

You now may drop by the Voice_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION America_ORGANIZATION offices in Washington_LOCATION and read the text of what the Voice_ORGANIZATION is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week . 
You can even take notes -- extensive notes , for the Voice_ORGANIZATION folks wo n't look over your shoulder -- about what you read . 
You can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress_ORGANIZATION . 

And my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts . 

Until the other day , you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world . 
That was the law . 
And I apparently had no right to print hither what the Voice_ORGANIZATION was booming to yon . 

It was censorship . 
It was outrageous . 
And it was stupid . 

The theory was that the Voice_ORGANIZATION is a propaganda agency and this government should n't propagandize its own people . 
That sounds neat , but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own people every day . 
Government press releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military facilities , publications are all propaganda of sorts . 
Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint , and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue . 

The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice_ORGANIZATION material were especially absurd : An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform . 

In June_DATE 1988_DATE , I wrote in this space about this issue . 
Assuming it was n't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door , I 'll review the facts . 

The Voice_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION America_ORGANIZATION is a government agency that broadcasts news and views -- some might say propaganda -- in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world . 
It does a first-rate job . 
Its budget $_MONEY 184_MONEY million_MONEY -- is paid for by you . 
But a 1948_DATE law barred the `` dissemination '' of that material in the U.S_LOCATION . 
The law let scholars , reporters and researchers read texts of VOA_ORGANIZATION material , only at VOA_ORGANIZATION headquarters in Washington_LOCATION , but it barred them from copying texts . 
And , of course , there 's that word `` dissemination . '' 

How 's that again ? `` You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying , '' a Voice_ORGANIZATION official explained when I asked . 
What if I tune in my short-wave radio , transcribe an editorial or program , and print it in my newspaper ? `` Nor are you free to reprint such material , '' I was advised . 

That sounded a lot like censorship , so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere , I sued . 

A couple of weeks ago , I lost the case in federal district court in Des_LOCATION Moines_LOCATION . 
At least , that 's the way it was reported . 
And , indeed , the lawsuit was dismissed . 

But I -- I like to think of it in terms of we , all of us -- won the point . 

For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling : The_ORGANIZATION United_ORGANIZATION States_ORGANIZATION Information_ORGANIZATION Agency_ORGANIZATION , which runs the Voice_ORGANIZATION , changed its position on three key points . 

-- The USIA_ORGANIZATION said that , on reflection , of course I could print anything I could get my hands on . 
The word dissemination , it decided , referred only to itself . `` The USIA_ORGANIZATION officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA_ORGANIZATION to disseminate agency program materials in the United_LOCATION States_LOCATION , '' my lawyer , the scholarly Mark_PERSON McCormick_PERSON of Des_LOCATION Moines_LOCATION , said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost . 
The court noted the new USIA_ORGANIZATION position but , just in case , officially found `` that Congress_ORGANIZATION did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA_ORGANIZATION information domestically . '' 

-- The USIA_ORGANIZATION said that , on reflection , anyone could view the VOA_ORGANIZATION materials , not just the reporters , scholars , researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute . `` The USIA_ORGANIZATION publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials , notwithstanding the statutory designations , because the USIA_ORGANIZATION has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials , '' Mr. McCormick_PERSON noted . 

-- And the USIA_ORGANIZATION said that all of us could take extensive notes . `` The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and , while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes , no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken , '' Mr. McCormick_PERSON reported . 

I had sought , in my suit , the right to print Voice_ORGANIZATION material , which had been denied me , and I had sought a right to receive the information , arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if I have no right to get the information . 

But the court disagreed . `` The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech , '' Judge Donald_PERSON O'Brien_PERSON ruled . `` The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press . '' 

So now the situation is this : You have a right to read Voice_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION America_ORGANIZATION scripts if you do n't mind traveling to Washington_LOCATION every week or so and visiting the Voice_ORGANIZATION office during business hours . 
I have a right to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- copy them out in long hand . 
But neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox_ORGANIZATION machine or have it sent to us . 

In an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not , this does seem odd . 

Indeed , Judge_PERSON O'Brien_PERSON ruled that `` it would be easy to conclude that the USIA_ORGANIZATION 's position is ` inappropriate or even stupid , ' '' but it 's the law . 
So the next step , I suspect , is to try to get the law changed . 
We ( I assume you 're in this with me at this point ) need to get three words -- `` for examination only '' -- eliminated from the law . 

Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948_DATE says Voice_ORGANIZATION material shall be available to certain of us ( but now , thanks to the USIA_ORGANIZATION 's new position , all of us ) `` for examination only . '' If those words were n't there , the nice people at the Voice_ORGANIZATION would be able to send you the information or , at the very least , let you photocopy it . 

This is not a trivial issue . 

`` You have . . . raised important questions which ought to be answered : What does USIA_ORGANIZATION say about America_LOCATION abroad ; how do we say it ; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions ? '' a man wrote me a couple of years ago . 
The man was Charles_PERSON Z._PERSON Wick_PERSON . 
At the time , he was director of the 

He had no answers then . 

Now there are some . 

This democracy is suddenly a little more democratic . 

I feel pretty good about it .
