The Internal_ORGANIZATION Revenue_ORGANIZATION Service_ORGANIZATION has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $_MONEY 10,000_MONEY in cash . 

The warnings , issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week , have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar , who claim the information is protected by attorney-client privilege . 

The IRS_ORGANIZATION warnings stem from a 1984_DATE law that requires anyone who receives more than $_MONEY 10,000_MONEY in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 . 
The form asks for such details as the client 's name , Social Security number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment . 

Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November_DATE , when Congress_ORGANIZATION determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison . 

Attorneys have argued since 1985_DATE , when the law took effect , that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known . 
Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the_ORGANIZATION IRS_ORGANIZATION in recent years , citing attorney-client privilege . 
Until last week , the_ORGANIZATION IRS_ORGANIZATION rarely acted on the incomplete forms . 

`` This form forces a lawyer to become , in effect , a witness against his client , '' said Neal_PERSON R._PERSON Sonnett_PERSON , president of the_ORGANIZATION National_ORGANIZATION Association_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Criminal_ORGANIZATION Defense_ORGANIZATION Lawyers_ORGANIZATION . `` The IRS_ORGANIZATION is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government , '' added Mr. Sonnett_PERSON , a Miami_LOCATION lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated IRS_ORGANIZATION forms sent by certified mail . 

Mr. Sonnett_PERSON said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts . 
These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers . 
Mr. Sonnett_PERSON said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers . 
Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the_ORGANIZATION IRS_ORGANIZATION off and spark action against the clients , he said . 
The defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week , chaired by New_LOCATION York_LOCATION attorney Gerald_PERSON Lefcourt_PERSON , to deal with the matter . 

The American_ORGANIZATION Bar_ORGANIZATION Association_ORGANIZATION 's_ORGANIZATION House_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Delegates_ORGANIZATION passed a resolution in 1985_DATE condemning the IRS_ORGANIZATION reporting requirement . 
Michael_PERSON Ross_PERSON , a New_LOCATION York_LOCATION lawyer who heads the ABA_ORGANIZATION 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA_ORGANIZATION 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death . 

Mr. Ross_PERSON said he met with officials of the_ORGANIZATION IRS_ORGANIZATION and the_ORGANIZATION Justice_ORGANIZATION Department_ORGANIZATION , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to discuss the issue last May_DATE . 
At that meeting , he said , the_ORGANIZATION Justice_ORGANIZATION Department_ORGANIZATION assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice . 
Mr. Ross_PERSON said IRS_ORGANIZATION officials opposed the_ORGANIZATION Justice_ORGANIZATION Department_ORGANIZATION 's moderate stance on the matter . 

But in the letters sent in recent days , Christopher_PERSON J._PERSON Lezovich_PERSON of the IRS_ORGANIZATION computing center in Detroit_LOCATION , told attorneys that `` failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . '' In some cases , the_ORGANIZATION IRS_ORGANIZATION asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985_DATE . 

A spokesman for the_ORGANIZATION IRS_ORGANIZATION confirmed that `` there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now . 
Individuals familiar with the_ORGANIZATION Justice_ORGANIZATION Department_ORGANIZATION 's policy said that Justice_ORGANIZATION officials had n't any knowledge of the IRS_ORGANIZATION 's actions in the last week . 

Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients , that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors . 
Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business . 
But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases . 

Some criminal lawyers speculated that the_ORGANIZATION IRS_ORGANIZATION was sending the letters to test the issue . 
In a number of recent cases , federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential . 

THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim . 

Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal Judge Raul_PERSON A._PERSON Ramirez_PERSON in Sacramento_LOCATION , Calif_LOCATION . 
On Tuesday_DATE , the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec._DATE 31_DATE to join a San_LOCATION Francisco_LOCATION law firm . 
The reason : the refusal of Congress_ORGANIZATION to give federal judges a raise . 

`` A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years , and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan , '' the judge quipped in an interview . 
Federal judges make $_MONEY 89,500_MONEY annually ; in February_DATE , Congress_ORGANIZATION rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50_PERCENT %_PERCENT . 

Judge Ramirez_PERSON , 44 , said it is unjust for judges to make what they do . `` Judges are not getting what they deserve . 
You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants . . . and nobody blinks an eye . 
When you become a federal judge , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . '' 

At his new job , as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento_LOCATION office of Orrick_ORGANIZATION ,_ORGANIZATION Herrington_ORGANIZATION &_ORGANIZATION Sutcliffe_ORGANIZATION , he will make out much better . 

The judge declined to discuss his salary in detail , but said : `` I 'm going to be a high-priced lawyer . '' 

DOONESBURY CREATOR 'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter . 

Cartoonist Garry_PERSON Trudeau_PERSON is suing the_ORGANIZATION Writers_ORGANIZATION Guild_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION America_ORGANIZATION East_ORGANIZATION for $_MONEY 11_MONEY million_MONEY , alleging it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line .

In his lawsuit , Mr. Trudeau_PERSON says the strike illegally included Darkhorse_ORGANIZATION , and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company . 
A spokesman for the guild said the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit . 
He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau_PERSON . 

Mr. Trudeau_PERSON 's attorney , Norman_PERSON K._PERSON Samnick_PERSON , said the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year-long threats of disciplinary action . 
Mr. Samnick_PERSON said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday_DATE in New_LOCATION York_LOCATION . 
Mr. Samnick_PERSON , who will go before the disciplinary panel , said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified . 

In addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. Trudeau_PERSON .

INQUIRY CLEARS TEXAS_LOCATION JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims . 

Dallas_LOCATION District Judge Jack_PERSON Hampton_PERSON had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December_DATE , two weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park . 
The judge was quoted as referring to the victims as `` queers '' and saying they would n't have been killed `` if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys . '' 

But Robert_PERSON R._PERSON Murray_PERSON , a special master appointed by the_ORGANIZATION Texas_ORGANIZATION Supreme_ORGANIZATION Court_ORGANIZATION , said Judge Hampton_PERSON did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case .
