USX_ORGANIZATION Corp._ORGANIZATION posted a 23_PERCENT %_PERCENT drop in third-quarter_DATE profit , as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations . 

The nation 's largest steelmaker earned $_MONEY 175_MONEY million_MONEY , or 62_MONEY cents_MONEY a share , compared with the year-earlier $_MONEY 228_MONEY million_MONEY , or 80_MONEY cents_MONEY a share . 
The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $_MONEY 98_MONEY million_MONEY from asset sales , while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $_MONEY 61_MONEY million_MONEY .

Sales rose 5_PERCENT %_PERCENT to $_MONEY 4.4_MONEY billion_MONEY from $_MONEY 4.2_MONEY billion_MONEY . 

The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third_DATE quarter_DATE , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing . 
However , third-quarter_DATE operating profit fell 14_PERCENT %_PERCENT , as USX_ORGANIZATION sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations . 

Among segments that continue to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets . 
Peter_PERSON Marcus_PERSON , an analyst with PaineWebber_ORGANIZATION Inc._ORGANIZATION , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX_ORGANIZATION results . 
Moreover , USX_ORGANIZATION exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure . 

The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain_LOCATION , Ohio_LOCATION , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan_LOCATION 's Kobe_ORGANIZATION Steel_ORGANIZATION Ltd_ORGANIZATION . 

In the steel division , operating profit dropped 11_PERCENT %_PERCENT to $_MONEY 85_MONEY million_MONEY . 
Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $_MONEY 33_MONEY a ton from $_MONEY 42_MONEY a ton last year and $_MONEY 53_MONEY a ton in the second_DATE quarter_DATE , analysts said . 
Still , USX_ORGANIZATION fared better than other major steelmakers , earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem_ORGANIZATION Steel_ORGANIZATION Corp._ORGANIZATION , which posted a 54_PERCENT %_PERCENT drop in net income , or Inland_ORGANIZATION Steel_ORGANIZATION Industries_ORGANIZATION Inc._ORGANIZATION , whose profit plummeted 70_PERCENT %_PERCENT . 

In New_ORGANIZATION York_ORGANIZATION Stock_ORGANIZATION Exchange_ORGANIZATION composite trading yesterday , USX_ORGANIZATION shares closed up $_MONEY 1.25_MONEY , at $_MONEY 34.625_MONEY , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales . 
The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that USX_ORGANIZATION 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' . 

Charles_PERSON Bradford_PERSON , an analyst with Merrill_ORGANIZATION Lynch_ORGANIZATION Capital_ORGANIZATION Markets_ORGANIZATION , said USX_ORGANIZATION may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year . 
He said USX_ORGANIZATION also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods . 

The energy segment , with a 15_PERCENT %_PERCENT rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest . 
Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon_ORGANIZATION Oil_ORGANIZATION Co._ORGANIZATION unit to $_MONEY 198_MONEY million_MONEY from $_MONEY 180_MONEY million_MONEY . 
The Texas_ORGANIZATION Oil_ORGANIZATION &_ORGANIZATION Gas_ORGANIZATION division continues to operate in the red , although losses narrowed to $_MONEY 9_MONEY million_MONEY from $_MONEY 15_MONEY million_MONEY .
