A lack of enthusiasm with the latest economic data hampered the stock market 's bid to extend Tuesday_DATE 's sharp gains , as prices closed slightly higher in sluggish trading . 

While renewed optimism about the outlook for takeover activity boosted several so-called deal stocks , traders said profit-taking weighed on the market , with blue-chips bearing the brunt of the selling . 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had jumped 41.60 points on Tuesday_DATE , drifted on either side of its previous close and finished with a gain of just 0.82 at 2645.90 . 

Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index added 0.84 to 341.20 ; the rise was equivalent to a gain of about six points in the industrial average .

The October_DATE survey of corporate purchasing managers , as expected , provided evidence that economic growth remains subdued . 
An index of economic activity drawn from the survey stood last month at 47.6_PERCENT %_PERCENT ; a reading above 50_PERCENT %_PERCENT would have indicated that the manufacturing sector was improving . 

But with the index proving somewhat better than expected and the widely anticipated report on October_DATE employment scheduled to arrive tomorrow , stock prices firmed only modestly in response to the report and then faltered . 

`` This market 's still going through its pains , '' said Philip_PERSON Puccio_PERSON , head of equity trading at Prudential-Bache_ORGANIZATION Securities_ORGANIZATION . `` The psychology is still : ` We want ( stocks ) up , but if they do n't carry we 're going to sell them . ' '' 

Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to curtail stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market , also contributed to its lack of direction , Mr. Puccio_PERSON said . 

Arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined largely to a round of buy programs near the close , which helped offset the impact of profit-taking among blue chips . 

Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow 's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates . `` I sense that some people are reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come out , '' said Richard_PERSON Eakle_PERSON , president of Eakle_ORGANIZATION Associates_ORGANIZATION , Fair_LOCATION Haven_LOCATION ,
