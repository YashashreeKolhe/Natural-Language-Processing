A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported . 

The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said . 
Lorillard_ORGANIZATION Inc._ORGANIZATION , the unit of New York-based Loews_ORGANIZATION Corp._ORGANIZATION that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956_DATE . 

Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem . 

A Lorillard_ORGANIZATION spokewoman said , `` This is an old story . 
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties . 
There is no asbestos in our products now . '' 

Neither Lorillard_ORGANIZATION nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes . `` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said James_PERSON A._PERSON Talcott_PERSON of Boston_LOCATION 's Dana-Farber_ORGANIZATION Cancer_ORGANIZATION Institute_ORGANIZATION . 
Dr. Talcott_PERSON led a team of researchers from the National_ORGANIZATION Cancer_ORGANIZATION Institute_ORGANIZATION and the medical schools of Harvard_ORGANIZATION University_ORGANIZATION and Boston_ORGANIZATION University_ORGANIZATION . 

The Lorillard_ORGANIZATION spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s_DATE and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956_DATE . 
From 1953_DATE to 1955_DATE , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said . 

Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number . 
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer . 
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said . 

`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases , '' said Dr. Talcott_PERSON . 

The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West_LOCATION Groton_LOCATION , Mass._LOCATION , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western_LOCATION industrialized countries , he said . 
The plant , which is owned by Hollingsworth_ORGANIZATION &_ORGANIZATION Vose_ORGANIZATION Co._ORGANIZATION , was under contract with Lorillard_ORGANIZATION to make the cigarette filters . 

The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S._LOCATION should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott_PERSON said . 

The U.S._LOCATION is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke_PERSON T._PERSON Mossman_PERSON , a professor of pathlogy at the University_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Vermont_ORGANIZATION College_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Medicine_ORGANIZATION . 
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman_PERSON explained . 

In July_DATE , the Environmental_ORGANIZATION Protection_ORGANIZATION Agency_ORGANIZATION imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos . 
By 1997_DATE , almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed . 

About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s_DATE . 
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used . 
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters . 
Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area . 

`` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases , '' said Darrell_PERSON Phillips_PERSON , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth_ORGANIZATION &_ORGANIZATION Vose_ORGANIZATION . `` But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago . 
It has no bearing on our work force today . ''
