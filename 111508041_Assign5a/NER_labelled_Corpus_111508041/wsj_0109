R._PERSON Gordon_PERSON McGovern_PERSON was forced out as Campbell_ORGANIZATION Soup_ORGANIZATION Co._ORGANIZATION 's president and chief executive officer , the strongest evidence yet of the power that Dorrance_PERSON family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company . 

Herbert_PERSON M._PERSON Baum_PERSON , the 53-year-old president of the company 's Campbell_ORGANIZATION U.S.A._ORGANIZATION unit , and Edwin_PERSON L._PERSON Harper_PERSON , 47 , the chief financial officer , will run Campbell_ORGANIZATION as a team , dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named . 
The board already has been searching for strong outside candidates , including food-industry executives with considerable international experience . 

Wall Street reacted favorably to Mr. McGovern_PERSON 's departure and its implications . 
In heavy trading on the New_ORGANIZATION York_ORGANIZATION Stock_ORGANIZATION Exchange_ORGANIZATION , Campbell_ORGANIZATION 's shares rose $_MONEY 3.375_MONEY to close at $_MONEY 47.125_MONEY . 

`` The profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better , '' said John_PERSON McMillin_PERSON , a food industry analyst for Prudential-Bache_ORGANIZATION in New_LOCATION York_LOCATION . 
Mr. McGovern_PERSON was widely seen as sales , and not profit , oriented . `` New managers would think a little more like Wall Street , '' Mr. McMillin_PERSON added . 
Some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation , which has contributed to volatility of Campbell_ORGANIZATION shares in recent months . 

Campbell_ORGANIZATION 's international businesses , particularly in the U.K._LOCATION and Italy_LOCATION , appear to be at the heart of its problems . 
Growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in U.S._LOCATION units . 

For example , Campbell_ORGANIZATION is a distant third in the U.K._LOCATION frozen foods market , where it recently paid 24 times earnings for Freshbake_ORGANIZATION Foods_ORGANIZATION PLC_ORGANIZATION and wound up with far more capacity than it could use . 
Similarly , Campbell_ORGANIZATION 's Italian biscuit operation , D._ORGANIZATION Lazzaroni_ORGANIZATION &_ORGANIZATION Co._ORGANIZATION , has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems . 

Such problems will require considerable skill to resolve . 
However , neither Mr. Baum_PERSON nor Mr. Harper_PERSON has much international experience . 

Mr. Baum_PERSON , a seasoned marketer who is said to have a good rapport with Campbell_ORGANIZATION employees , will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the Pepperidge_ORGANIZATION Farm_ORGANIZATION unit . 
Mr. Harper_PERSON , a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined Campbell_ORGANIZATION in 1986_DATE , will take charge of all overseas operations as well as Pepperidge_ORGANIZATION . 

In an joint interview yesterday , both men said they would like to be the company 's next chief executive . 

Mr. McGovern_PERSON , 63 , had been under intense pressure from the board to boost Campbell_ORGANIZATION 's mediocre performance to the level of other food companies . 
The board is dominated by the heirs of the late John_PERSON T._PERSON Dorrance_PERSON Jr._PERSON , who controlled about 58_PERCENT %_PERCENT of Campbell_ORGANIZATION 's stock when he died in April_DATE . 
In recent months , Mr. Dorrance_PERSON 's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity . 

In August_DATE , the company took a $_MONEY 343_MONEY million_MONEY pretax charge against fiscal 1989_DATE earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan . 
The plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 jobs . 
But analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing , especially in Europe_LOCATION , and there were signs that the board became impatient . 

Campbell officials said Mr. McGovern_PERSON was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure . 
The company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying , `` The CEO succession is well along and I 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement . '' 

But people familiar with the agenda of the board 's meeting last week in London_LOCATION said Mr. McGovern_PERSON was fired . 

Mr. McGovern_PERSON himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October_DATE 1991_DATE , `` unless I get fired . '' Campbell_ORGANIZATION said Mr. McGovern_PERSON had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting , scheduled for Nov._DATE 17_DATE . 

For fiscal 1989_DATE , Mr. McGovern_PERSON received a salary of $_MONEY 877,663_MONEY . 
He owns about 45,000 shares of Campbell_ORGANIZATION stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares . 
He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $_MONEY 244,000_MONEY with certain other fringe benefits . 

During Mr. McGovern_PERSON 's nine-year term as president , the company 's sales rose to $_MONEY 5.7_MONEY billion_MONEY from $_MONEY 2.8_MONEY billion_MONEY and net income increased to $_MONEY 274_MONEY million_MONEY from $_MONEY 130_MONEY million_MONEY , the statement said . 

Mr. Baum_PERSON said he and Mr. Harper_PERSON both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988_DATE . `` You 've got to make the restructuring work , '' said Mr. Baum_PERSON . `` You 've got to make those savings now . '' 

Mr. Harper_PERSON expressed confidence that he and Mr. Baum_PERSON can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company . `` We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team , '' he said . 
He predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive . 

Mr. Baum_PERSON said the two have orders to `` focus on bottom-line profits '' and to `` take a hard look at our businesses -- what is good , what is not so good . '' Analysts generally applaud the performance of Campbell_ORGANIZATION U.S.A._ORGANIZATION , the company 's largest division , which posted 6_PERCENT %_PERCENT unit sales growth and a 15_PERCENT %_PERCENT improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989_DATE . `` The way that we 've been managing Campbell_ORGANIZATION U.S.A._ORGANIZATION can hopefully spread to other areas of the company , '' Mr. Baum_PERSON said . 

In the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon , both men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together . `` You 've got two champions sitting right before you , '' said Mr. Baum_PERSON . `` We play to win . ''
