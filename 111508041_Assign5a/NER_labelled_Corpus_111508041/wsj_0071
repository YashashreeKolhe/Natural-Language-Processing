When Warren_PERSON Winiarski_PERSON , proprietor of Stag_ORGANIZATION 's_ORGANIZATION Leap_ORGANIZATION Wine_ORGANIZATION Cellars_ORGANIZATION in Napa_LOCATION Valley_LOCATION , announced a $_MONEY 75_MONEY price tag for his 1985_DATE Cask 23 Cabernet this fall_DATE , few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked . `` This is the peak of my wine-making experience , '' Mr. Winiarski_PERSON declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New_LOCATION York_LOCATION , `` and I wanted to single it out as such . '' 

It is in my estimation the best wine Stag_ORGANIZATION 's_ORGANIZATION Leap_ORGANIZATION has produced , and with fewer than 700 cases available , it is sure to sell quickly . 
The price is a new high for California_LOCATION Cabernet Sauvignon , but it is not the highest . 
Diamond_ORGANIZATION Creek_ORGANIZATION 1985_DATE Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall_DATE with a sticker price of $_MONEY 100_MONEY a bottle . 

One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production , of exceptional quality ( or so perceived , at any rate ) , and with exceedingly high prices . 
For years , this group included a stable of classics -- Bordeaux_LOCATION first growths ( Lafite-Rothschild , Latour , Haut-Brion , Petrus ) , Grand_LOCATION Cru_LOCATION Burgundies ( Romanee-Conti and La Tache ) deluxe Champagnes ( Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal ) , rarefied sweet wines ( Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany_LOCATION , and Biondi-Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany_LOCATION ) . 
These first magnitude wines ranged in price from $_MONEY 40_MONEY to $_MONEY 125_MONEY a bottle . 

In the last year or so , however , this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members . 
The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition , and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle , among current releases from every major wine region on the globe . 

France_LOCATION can boast the lion 's share of high-priced bottles . 
Bordeaux_LOCATION 's first growths from 1985_DATE and 1986_DATE are $_MONEY 60_MONEY to $_MONEY 80_MONEY each ( except for the smallest in terms of production , Chateau Petrus , which costs around $_MONEY 250_MONEY ! ) . 
These prices seem rather modest , however , in light of other French_LOCATION wines from current vintages . 
Chateau Yquem , the leading Sauternes , now goes for well over $_MONEY 100_MONEY a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984_DATE ; the spectacularly rich 1983_DATE runs $_MONEY 179_MONEY . 

In Champagne , some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $_MONEY 100_MONEY a bottle . 
The first Champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979_DATE Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs . 
The '82 Salon is $_MONEY 115_MONEY . 
Roederer Cristal at $_MONEY 90_MONEY a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger_ORGANIZATION 's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level . 
The great reds of the Rhone_LOCATION Valley_LOCATION have soared in price as well . 
E._ORGANIZATION Guigal_ORGANIZATION 's 1982_DATE Cote Rotie La Landonne , for example , is $_MONEY 120_MONEY . 

None of France_LOCATION 's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy_LOCATION , however . 
The six wines of the Domaine_ORGANIZATION de_ORGANIZATION la_ORGANIZATION Romanee-Conti_ORGANIZATION , 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world , have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now . 
With the 1985_DATE vintage , they soared higher : La Tache , $_MONEY 195_MONEY ; Richebourg , $_MONEY 180_MONEY ; Romanee-Conti , $_MONEY 225_MONEY . 
Another small Burgundy_LOCATION estate , Coche-Dury_ORGANIZATION , has just offered its 1987_DATE Corton-Charlemagne for $_MONEY 155_MONEY . 

From Italy_LOCATION there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $_MONEY 125_MONEY a bottle , Piero_PERSON Antinori_PERSON 's La Solaia , a $_MONEY 90_MONEY Cabernet from Tuscany_LOCATION , and Biondi-Santi Brunello at $_MONEY 98_MONEY . 
Spain_LOCATION 's Vega Secilia Unico 1979_DATE ( released only in its 10th year ) is $_MONEY 70_MONEY , as is Australia_LOCATION 's Grange Hermitage 1982_DATE . 

`` There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices , '' says Larry_PERSON Shapiro_PERSON of Marty_ORGANIZATION 's , one of the largest wine shops in Dallas_LOCATION . `` What 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out . 
We 're seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce . '' 

Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines , Mr. Shapiro_PERSON continued : `` We 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s_DATE and '50s_DATE , which go for $_MONEY 300_MONEY to $_MONEY 400_MONEY a bottle . 
Some of the newer wines , even at $_MONEY 90_MONEY to $_MONEY 100_MONEY a bottle or so , almost offer a bargain . '' 

Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond_ORGANIZATION Creek_ORGANIZATION . 
It 's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly ( the last was 1979_DATE ) and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987_DATE . 
Owner Al_PERSON Brownstein_PERSON originally planned to sell it for $_MONEY 60_MONEY a bottle , but when a retailer in Southern_LOCATION California_LOCATION asked , `` Is that wholesale or retail ? '' he re-thought the matter . 
Offering the wine at roughly $_MONEY 65_MONEY a bottle wholesale ( $_MONEY 100_MONEY retail ) , he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 ) no , the wine is too high ( 2 responses ) ; 2 ) yes , it 's high but I 'll take it ( 2 responses ) ; 3 ) I 'll take all I can get ( 58 responses ) . 
The wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12 , but even at that it was spread thin , going to 62 retailers in 28 states . 

`` We thought it was awfully expensive , '' said Sterling_PERSON Pratt_PERSON , wine director at Schaefer_ORGANIZATION 's in Skokie_LOCATION ,_LOCATION Ill._LOCATION , one of the top stores in suburban Chicago_LOCATION , `` but there are people out there with very different opinions of value . 
We got our two six-packs -- and they 're gone . '' 

Mr. Pratt_PERSON remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on . 
Even if there is consumer resistance at first , a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move . `` There may be sticker-shock reaction initially , '' said Mr. Pratt_PERSON , `` but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell , they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection . '' 

`` It 's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people , '' added Larry_PERSON Shapiro_PERSON . `` They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace { one of Diamond_ORGANIZATION Creek_ORGANIZATION 's Cabernets } or the Dunn_ORGANIZATION 1985_DATE Cabernet , or the Petrus . 
Producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people . '' 

That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly . 
But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago . `` They wo n't buy if the quality is not there , '' said Cedric_PERSON Martin_PERSON of Martin_ORGANIZATION Wine_ORGANIZATION Cellar_ORGANIZATION in New_LOCATION Orleans_LOCATION . `` Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less . '' Mr. Martin_PERSON has increased prices on some wines ( like Grgich_ORGANIZATION Hills_ORGANIZATION Chardonnay , now $_MONEY 32_MONEY ) just to slow down movement , but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $_MONEY 30_MONEY to $_MONEY 40_MONEY range . 

Image has , of course , a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't , and it ca n't be forced . 
Wine merchants ca n't keep Roederer Cristal in stock , but they have to push Salon le Mesnil , even lowering the price from $_MONEY 115_MONEY to $_MONEY 90_MONEY . 
It 's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982_DATE Salon is a beautiful wine , but , as Mr. Pratt_PERSON noted , people have their own ideas about value . 

It 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door . 
In every major market in the U.S._LOCATION , for instance , you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg , virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux_LOCATION ( except Petrus ) , as well as Opus One and Dominus from California_LOCATION and , at the moment , the Stag_ORGANIZATION 's_ORGANIZATION Leap_ORGANIZATION 1985_DATE Cask 23 . 

With the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach , it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare . 
By January_DATE it should be fairly clear what 's hot -- and what 's not .
