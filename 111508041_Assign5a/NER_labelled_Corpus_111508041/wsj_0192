The record corn-buying binge by the Soviet_LOCATION Union_LOCATION is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S._LOCATION grain pipeline . 

The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested Midwest_LOCATION crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships . 

River barge rates have soared 40_PERCENT %_PERCENT this fall_DATE from a year earlier . 
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business . 
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets . 

The Soviet_LOCATION Union_LOCATION bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S._LOCATION corn in October_DATE , which is the most ever sold to the Soviet_LOCATION Union_LOCATION in one month from the U.S_LOCATION . 
The Soviet_LOCATION Union_LOCATION wants much of it delivered by January_DATE , which would be a strain in most years . 

But it is particularly difficult this autumn_DATE because of low water levels on the Mississippi_LOCATION River_LOCATION , on which flows much of the U.S._LOCATION corn that is shipped overseas . 

`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said William_PERSON Dunton_PERSON , a U.S._ORGANIZATION Agriculture_ORGANIZATION Department_ORGANIZATION transportation expert . `` It is going to be real tight . '' 

Because of persistent dry weather in the northern_LOCATION Plains_LOCATION , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi_LOCATION River_LOCATION is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time . 

In a few weeks , many barges probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of St._LOCATION Louis_LOCATION because the U.S._ORGANIZATION Army_ORGANIZATION Corps_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Engineers_ORGANIZATION is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri_LOCATION River_LOCATION , which feeds into the Mississippi_LOCATION River_LOCATION . 
The Army_ORGANIZATION Corps_ORGANIZATION is cutting the flow of the Missouri_LOCATION River_LOCATION about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it . 

Barge rates on the Mississippi_LOCATION River_LOCATION sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest_LOCATION might temporarily alleviate the situation . 

But the Army_ORGANIZATION Corps_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Engineers_ORGANIZATION expects the river level to continue falling this month . 
At St._LOCATION Louis_LOCATION , the water level of the Mississippi_LOCATION River_LOCATION is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri_LOCATION River_LOCATION is slowed , an Army_ORGANIZATION Corps_ORGANIZATION spokesman said . 
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years . 

So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago_ORGANIZATION Board_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Trade_ORGANIZATION . 
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers . 

At the Board_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Trade_ORGANIZATION yesterday the price of the corn contract for December_DATE delivery slipped 3.5_MONEY cents_MONEY a bushel to settle at $_MONEY 2.375_MONEY a bushel . 

Corn prices have been sluggish this fall_DATE despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988_DATE drought . 
With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S._LOCATION exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver . 

Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices . 
Because the drought reduced U.S._LOCATION stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise . 

In parts of Iowa_LOCATION , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $_MONEY 2.15_MONEY a bushel for corn . 
Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20_MONEY cents_MONEY a bushel , said Lyle_PERSON Reed_PERSON , president of Chicago_ORGANIZATION Central_ORGANIZATION &_ORGANIZATION Pacific_ORGANIZATION Railroad_ORGANIZATION Co._ORGANIZATION of Waterloo_LOCATION , Iowa_LOCATION . 

It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game . 
Although U.S._LOCATION corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture_ORGANIZATION Department_ORGANIZATION projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990_DATE corn harvest begins . 

Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation . `` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill_PERSON Biedermann_PERSON , Allendale_ORGANIZATION Inc._ORGANIZATION research director . 

Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New_LOCATION Orleans_LOCATION by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi_LOCATION River_LOCATION by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port . 

Ports in the Great_LOCATION Lakes_LOCATION and Atlantic_LOCATION Coast_LOCATION can also relieve pressure on New_LOCATION Orleans_LOCATION . 
One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana_LOCATION to Baltimore_LOCATION . 

And it is n't clear that the Soviet_LOCATION Union_LOCATION will stay on its record buying pace . 
The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October_DATE because of delays . 
The Soviet_LOCATION Union_LOCATION usually begins buying U.S._LOCATION crops earlier in the fall_DATE . 
But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems . 

In other commodity markets yesterday : 

ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil . 
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market . 
Heating oil for November_DATE delivery ended at 58.64_MONEY cents_MONEY a gallon , up one_MONEY cent_MONEY on the New_ORGANIZATION York_ORGANIZATION Mercantile_ORGANIZATION Exchange_ORGANIZATION . 
West Texas Intermediate for December_DATE delivery advanced 22_MONEY cents_MONEY to $_MONEY 19.94_MONEY a barrel . 
Gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday_DATE . 

PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets . 
December_DATE delivery gold fell $_MONEY 3.20_MONEY an ounce to $_MONEY 377.60_MONEY . 
December_DATE silver declined 6.50_MONEY cents_MONEY an ounce to $_MONEY 5.2180_MONEY . 
January_DATE platinum was down $_MONEY 5.70_MONEY an ounce at $_MONEY 494.50_MONEY . 
Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William_PERSON O'Neill_PERSON , vice president of research at Elders_ORGANIZATION Futures_ORGANIZATION in New_LOCATION York_LOCATION . `` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said . 
Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , he said . 
Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , he said . 
Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity_ORGANIZATION Exchange_ORGANIZATION , he said . 
Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman . 

COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered Monday_DATE 's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike . 
The December_DATE contract rose 1.20_MONEY cents_MONEY a pound to $_MONEY 1.14_MONEY . 
In Chile_LOCATION , workers at two copper mines , Los_LOCATION Bronces_LOCATION and El_LOCATION Soldado_LOCATION , which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera_ORGANIZATION Disputada_ORGANIZATION , yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow , an analyst said . 
Reasons for the walkout , the analyst said , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike . 
The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks . 
In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal . 
Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted , was a report by Chicago_LOCATION purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold . 
The Purchasing_ORGANIZATION Management_ORGANIZATION Association_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Chicago_ORGANIZATION 's October_DATE index rose to 51.6_PERCENT %_PERCENT after three previous months of readings below 50_PERCENT %_PERCENT . 
The September_DATE index was 47.1_PERCENT %_PERCENT . 
A reading below 50_PERCENT %_PERCENT generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy , while a reading above 50_PERCENT %_PERCENT points to expansion . 
The Chicago_LOCATION report raised the possibility that the October_DATE survey of the National_ORGANIZATION Association_ORGANIZATION of_ORGANIZATION Purchasing_ORGANIZATION Management_ORGANIZATION would also show a reading above 50_PERCENT %_PERCENT .
